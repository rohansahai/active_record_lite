###Active Record Lite

The purpose of this project was to understand more deeply how ActiveRecord works. Specifically the ORM aspect of translating rich objects of an application to tables in a relational database management system. Mass assignment, associations, AR querying, and persistnence methods are all covered in this code!

Lots of Ruby meta programming was used to accomplish this.
